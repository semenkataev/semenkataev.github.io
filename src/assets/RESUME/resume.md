Semen did a fantastic job as B-ID Coordinator. The B-ID is a Universal Bus Pass distributed to over ten thousand students at the University of Toronto Mississauga. It is used by students to ride the bus at a tremendously discounted flat rate, and therefore B-ID pick-up and distribution is an event of interest to all students whom culminate all at once to get it, creating a hectic, time-pressured and crowded distribution process. Each card has a monetary value in excess of a few hundred dollars and thus careful handling, ID verification and due diligence is key to managing risk and ensuring integrity within the distribution process. Semen performed this job diligently. He was in charge of hiring multiple B-ID clerks whom he vetted, interviewed and managed, and for setting up the distribution stations and overseeing the entire affair. This required careful supervision, early mornings, training of the clerks on pertinent protocols, implementing internal controls and checks, and reporting back to myself and the UTMSU executives on how things were going. I am overjoyed to say Semen did a magnificent job with no hiccups, leading to thousands of happy students with pass in hand - all accomplished within just a tight window of a few days. Semen's integrity, work ethic, critical reasoning and interpersonal skills demonstrated are highly commendable and transferable to a plethora of fields. He has also been a tremendous help as a student leader within the student union, encouraging students to come together to address social justice issues, such as poverty and discrimination. A man of valor and integrity - that is Semen!
